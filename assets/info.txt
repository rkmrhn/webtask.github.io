##Research

research=Research Areas

research areas=<<Numerical analysis and scientific computing for deterministic and stochastic fractional partial differential equations.>>_My research focuses on the numerical analysis of deterministic linear and non-linear fractional partial differential equations, emphasizing the development of computational methods to ensure accurate and efficient solutions. I am particularly interested in exploring stability, convergence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions, which contribute to a deeper understanding of complex dynamic systems.|<<Stochastic numerical methods.>>_My research interests include the development and application of stochastic numerical methods for linear and non-linear fractional dynamical systems. I focus on analyzing the convergence, stability, and accuracy of these methods to effectively capture the probabilistic nature of solutions in complex systems. By integrating stochastic approaches, my work aims to address the challenges posed by uncertainty and variability in fractional dynamics, providing robust tools for predicting and understanding the behavior of systems influenced by random perturbations.
